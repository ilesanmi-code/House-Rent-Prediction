# House-Rent-Prediction

The dataset was gotten from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/house-rent-prediction-dataset

In this Dataset, we have information on almost 4700+ Houses/Apartments/Flats Available 
for Rent with different parameters like BHK, Rent, Size, No. of Floors, Area Type, Area Locality, City,
Furnishing Status, Type of Tenant Preferred, No. of Bathrooms, Point of Contact.

I performed exploratory analysis and then performed correlations to pick the features with the highest correlation with the Rent price -- #Feature Selection
And also, I performed feature encoding on the city column

Of all the models tried, Random Forest gave the highest Training and Testing accuracy.
(All Models used are on the Notebook)

Also, I built it into a Web App using Streamlit
